## Introduction

Spam email detection is a fundamental task in email filtering. This project utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular and effective technique for text classification, to identify spam emails. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook for easy understanding and experimentation.

## Demo

Insert a GIF or link to a demo showcasing your project in action. You can use tools like [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) to create terminal-based demos or screen recording software for GUI demos.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SpamEmailDetection-NaiveBayes.git
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook spam_detection.ipynb
```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell. This includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

3. Experiment with different parameters and techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Results

After running the notebook, you'll find the evaluation results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the spam email detection model. Interpret these metrics to understand the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes algorithm for this task.
